# COVID Data Analysis

Hi,This project is all about analyzing COVID-19 data using PySpark and visualizing it in Power BI.I've worked on fetching the data,processing it using PySpark and then creating a report that helps understand the trends in India.

## What Iâ€™ve used:
- **PySpark** for data cleaning and transformation
- **Power BI** to build a detailed dashboard
- **Python** scripts for automation
- **GitHub** for version control


## How to Run:
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.

  git clone https://github.com/monalisharoutray/covid-data-pipeline.git
  cd covid-data-pipeline
  
2. Run the PySpark script inside scripts/ to process the data.

  python scripts/covid_processing.py

3. Open the .pbix file in Power BI to view the report.
4. You can also update the source in Power BI to refresh with new data.

## What the Dashboard Shows:
- New cases and deaths daily
- State-wise breakdown


Feel free to explore and share feedback!
Thanks!
